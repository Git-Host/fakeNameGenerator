# Fake Name Generator
A fake name generator that uses Turkish data as default, written in PHP.

## Usage
First of all if you're going to use it locally and don't have a web server, install one, like Apache.
Then just get a `Google API` for geocoding, plug it in code and you are ready to go.

Open it up in your favourite browser, it creates random data with every page refresh.

## Contributing
Fork it, create a branch, commit your changes, push, request a pull. It's that easy :D

I accept and would be happy about all kinds of contribution, send me an e-mail & contact me on Twitter or just reach me on Github if you see some stuff which can be better or if you want to add something.
